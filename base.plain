***definitions***
- :App: is a RESTFul API.
- :AccessToken: is a token that allows a user to access the :App:.
- :Authentication: is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

***implementation reqs***
- The implementation should be in Java 21.
- The :App: should be implemented in the Springboot framework.
- The Spring Boot Maven Plugin should be configured with a classifier (e.g., 'exec') to distinguish the executable JAR from the standard JAR artifact.
- The build configuration should support proper dependency management and executable packaging for deployment.
- Data model validators should be reused.
- For generating getters, setters, constructors and other boilerplate code use lombook library. For validation use jakarta.validation library.
- The :App: should include unit tests using Java's built-in testing package and should be put in `src/test/java` folder.
- The data models should ignore unknown fields. 
- The validators should be reused wherever possible.
- When serializing data models into JSON, null fields should be skipped unless specifically set.
- Logging level should be set to DEBUG mode for logging.level.root. All other logging levels should be set to WARN (from springframework and apache).
- :App: should return 404 status code for unknown endpoints. The response body should be empty.
- :App: should use a in-memory database.
- :AccessToken: should be JWT tokens and the :App: should be able to validate them and identify the user associated with the token.

***test reqs***
- :ConformanceTests: of the :App: should be implemented in Java and will be built and tested with Maven.
- :ConformanceTests: should contain their own pom.xml at the root of the :ConformanceTests: folder (<CONFORMANCE_TESTS_FOLDER>).
- :ConformanceTests: will be executed using the "mvn test" command and therefore pom.xml has to include all test files available in the project.
- :ConformanceTests: will be run using these scripts: 
    - [test_scripts/prepare_environment_java.sh](test_scripts/prepare_environment_java.sh)
    - [test_scripts/run_conformance_tests.sh](test_scripts/run_conformance_tests.sh)
- :ConformanceTests: should contain a lot of logging statements to make debugging easier.
- :ConformanceTests: should use minimal sleep and iteration times to speed up the tests.
- :ConformanceTests: that invoke the :App: APIs should first start the server and then execute the tests.
- :ConformanceTests: that test the :App: Spring Boot Controller should use the @SpringBootTest annotation.
